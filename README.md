# Two Regimes of Missingness

Code, pre-registrations, aggregate results and figures for the article of the same title
(Vivatchai Kaveeta, Prompong Sugunnasil, Juggapong Natwichai, Chiang Mai University). Generated from the authors' research monorepo at
commit `9fa2ce7` on 2026-09-23 by `build_release.py`; the generator's verification step imported the
library and regenerated the tables and figures in this tree.

## Layout
- `src/hgmiss/` — the library (estimators, baselines, protocol, metrics, data loaders).
- `experiments/` — every experiment script the article uses, and the queue tooling the runs were made with.
- `figures/` — the figure and table generators (run from inside `figures/`), the figures, and their aggregate inputs.
- `results/` — aggregate outputs (per seed and fold, or per decision for public collections) that the tables are built from; files over 1 MB are gzip-compressed and `reproduce.sh` inflates them.
- `figures/` — the figures as they appear in the article.


## Reproduce the tables and figures from the shipped results
```
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .
./reproduce.sh
```

## Re-run the experiments
MIMIC-IV and eICU require PhysioNet credentialed access; build the site matrices with experiments/mimic4_sites.py and experiments/eicu_sites.py. The public collections are fetched from OpenML by the build scripts in experiments/.
Set `PLCO_ROOT` to the PLCO directory where applicable. Runs are launched through `experiments/spinner_runner.py`
(a queue runner) or directly, e.g. `python experiments/run_h1_h4.py --cohort lung`.

## Data not included
Nothing was withheld; every result file the scripts reference is included.
